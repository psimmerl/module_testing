# Data Information

We store the ROOT histograms generated by `analyze-waveforms` and the RDataFrames containing the waveform integrations for all events. 

Files are stored in Git LFS and need to be less than 2 GB.

## calibration

## ov_tt_scan

Overvoltage and trigger threshold working point scan.

Currently done only on module 200 041 and the temperature information is not stored, it could be a good idea to ignore the first few runs as they may have not reached thermal equilibrium yet.

There is an additional file called `scan_log.csv` with information about the scan.

## all_modules

Here is all of the standard module data recorded at an overvoltage of X.XXV (OPTIMIZED WORKING POINT) and trigger threshold of -XXmV (OPTIMIZED WORKING POINT).

If the module ID ends with an `R`, the module was rotated such that the `B` SiPM was in the `A` readout and `A` SiPM was in the `B` readout.


## bad_resistor

Example data from when one resistor in the QAQC jig was faulty. Used as a reference for when more QAQC jigs are built and need to be diagnosed.

One of the pi-pad resistors on channel 5 was free-floating and therefore the signal was not attenuated properly.

## temperature_scan

For studying how the temperature of the SiPM affects the breakdown volatage and gain.
